## 0.3.0 (2014-08-14)
- Spring 3.2.x compatibility (previously only 4.0.x)
- Divided nflow-engine API to internal and public java packages
- Added 'executor group' concept: nFlow engines update heartbeat in database; workflow instances reserved for dead engines are auto-recovered 
- integration to metrics library http://metrics.codahale.com/
- Starting nFlow engine through Spring lifecycle listener
- Allow custom ThreadFactory for creating nFlow threads
- Handle request data attached to workflow instances as state variable
- Timestamps (created, modified, etc) always set by database
- Splitted RepositoryService into WorkflowInstanceService and WorkflowDefinitionService
- Service for waking up workflow instances
- REST API: always return timestamps in ISO-8601 format
- Use 'official' JodaModule for DateTime (de)serialization
- Workflow instance idempotency management moved from nflow-rest to nflow-engine
- Support for legacy MySql databases (5.5 or below)
- Support for MariaDB 5.5.5
- Coveralls - GitHub integration
- Manual and end states no longer require handler methods; unexistent handler method causes workflow instance to be descheduled

- Bug fix: state variables were saved multiple times, if the next workflow step was immediately executed
