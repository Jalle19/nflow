Edfge styles
------------
Basic edge types are
- normal: normal transition
- error: error transition
- unexpected: any transition not part of workflow definition. Unexpected is always active.

Edges may be one of:
- <none>: with workflow definition
- passive: when transition has not been used by workflow instance
- active: when transition has been used by workflow instance

Edge may be also be selected.

So error edge, that has not been used and is selected is indicated like this

class="edge-error edge-passive selected"
