// The convertSwagger2markup plugin creates three separate files:
//    overview.adoc
//    path.adoc
//    definitions.adoc
// We will combine them into one. This has the benefit that HTML and PDF
// links that are created in paths.adoc, will actually link to items in
// definitions.adoc.

include::overview.adoc[]
include::paths.adoc[]
include::definitions.adoc[]
